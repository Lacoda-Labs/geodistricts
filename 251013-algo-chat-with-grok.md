## Prompt
for geodistricting to work, realiable geo geometry of census tracts is required.
census tracts need to be sorted by their adjacent and latitude or longitude such that a latitude sort order census tracts beginning with northwest most tracts, then selecting adjacent tract that is most northeast. similar approach when sorting by longitude. this is the most critical aspect of the algorithm. with a geographical sorting of census tracts, then diviiding the sorted tracts list by population according to a specified ration is trivial.
so far, algorithms that use the tract centroid coordinates works well but produces Discontiguous districts. the reason is the sorted list does not account for adjacentcy. 
to solve this problem, several different approach have been attempted.it seems calculating Adjacency is not reliable or problematic.
further challenges exist when census tracts are large because Population is more sparse. this is why the most northern or eastern geo points (vs centroid) is preferred.
any ideas on a reliable method for sorting census tracts so that dividing the sorted list of tracts produces the best equally grouping of census tracts such that after repeated sorting iteration (alternating sorting by latitude then longitude) the end results are target number of districts for a state have close to target populations and contiguous (unless geographic barriers exist, e.g. water, islands, mountains, etc).

### Reliable Method for Sorting Census Tracts in Geo Districts

Your description nails the core challenge: a geographic sorting method must prioritize **adjacency** (to ensure contiguity) while incorporating directional bias (e.g., northwest-to-northeast progression) and handling sparse/large tracts via extreme geo-points (e.g., northernmost/easternmost vertices). Simple centroid-based sorting fails on contiguity because it ignores neighbor relationships, and raw adjacency computation can be error-prone or slow for polygons (e.g., due to floating-point precision in intersection tests).

Based on established geographic algorithms and tools (e.g., graph traversals for redistricting and space-filling curves for locality-preserving sorts), I'll propose **two reliable, implementable methods**. Both leverage **pre-computed adjacency data** to sidestep unreliable on-the-fly calculations—specifically, the free, nationwide adjacency files from the Brown University S4 project's Diversity and Disparities dataset (or). These files provide a "Queen's contiguity" weights matrix (including self-loops) for all U.S. census tracts (1990–2020), derived from TIGER/Line shapefiles. They're accurate, fast to load (CSV format, ~10–50 MB per year), and handle barriers like water/islands implicitly (no edge if no shared boundary).

Download them from https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/Pooling.htm: Select year (e.g., 2020), format (CSV), and get `tract_2020.csv` (tract IDs) + `nlist_2020.csv` (FID = focal tract ID, NID = neighbor ID). Caveat: Overlapping neighborhoods when pooling, but perfect for traversal; 2005–2009 ACS files have minor ID inconsistencies (use 2010/2020 for your prototype).

These methods alternate lat/long sorts as you described, using the sorted list to divide by population ratio (trivial with cumulative sums). They output a linear order of tracts that, when chunked (e.g., first 1/3 for a 3-district state), yields contiguous groups with ~equal population. For barriers, the graph ensures no cross-water jumps.

#### Method 1: Graph-Based Greedy Directional Traversal (Recommended Primary—Guarantees Contiguity)
This treats tracts as nodes in an adjacency graph and performs a **greedy depth-first traversal (DFT)** starting from the NW-most tract, always prioritizing the "most northeast" unvisited neighbor. It's inspired by redistricting traversal algorithms and polygonal reconfiguration, ensuring 100% contiguity (path-connected) unless isolated by barriers. Runtime: O(E log V) per sort (V = tracts, E = edges; ~10k tracts/state, feasible).

**Steps**:
1. **Build Adjacency Graph** (Once per state/year):
   - Load S4 files into a dict-of-lists: `adj = defaultdict(list)`; for each row in `nlist_2020.csv`, if FID != NID, add NID to adj[FID].
   - Use tract polygons (from Census TIGER/Line GeoJSON via GeoPandas) for extreme points: For each tract, compute `north_lat = max(y for geom in polygon.exterior.coords)`, `east_long = max(x for geom in polygon.exterior.coords)`. Store in a tract metadata DF.
   - For sparse/large tracts: Use `north_lat` for lat-sorts, `east_long` for long-sorts (avoids centroid bias toward population centers).

2. **Find Starting Tract** (NW-most for lat-sort; SW-most for long-sort):
   - For lat-sort (north-to-south bias): Min `east_long`, then max `north_lat`.
   - For long-sort (west-to-east bias): Min `north_lat`, then max `east_long`.
   - Use GeoPandas spatial index for quick min/max queries.

3. **Greedy Traversal for Sorting**:
   - Initialize: `sorted_tracts = []`, visited set with start, priority queue (heapq) seeded with start's neighbors, keyed by "directional score".
   - Directional score (northeast bias): For a candidate neighbor from current tract, score = `(neighbor.north_lat - current.north_lat) + ε * (neighbor.east_long - current.east_long)`, where ε ~0.01 (scales lat/long units; tune via state bounding box).
     - This favors "up-right" moves; negate for south/east if needed in iterations.
   - While queue: Pop highest-score neighbor; if unvisited, add to `sorted_tracts`, mark visited, push its unvisited neighbors with scores relative to *it*.
   - If graph has disconnected components (e.g., islands), restart from next NW-most unvisited tract, appending to list (minimal discontiguity).

4. **Alternate and Divide**:
   - Iteration 1: Lat-sort → divide list into ratios (e.g., 50/50 cumulative pop).
   - Iteration 2: Long-sort on each half → subdivide.
   - Repeat until target districts; post-check contiguity via graph (DFS from first tract in chunk).

**Pros**: Perfect contiguity, handles barriers/sparsity via extremes + graph. Reliable adjacency from S4.
**Cons**: Greedy may not be perfectly linear (slight zigzags), but better than centroids.
**Implementation Tip**: In Python/GeoPandas: `gdf = gpd.read_file('tl_2020_tract.shp')`; compute extremes with `gdf.bounds`; build adj from S4 CSV. Test on small state like Wyoming (1 district, trivial).

#### Method 2: Hilbert Curve Locality-Preserving Sort (Alternative—Fast, Approximate Contiguity)
Use a **Hilbert space-filling curve** to map 2D geo-coords to a 1D index, sorting tracts by this index. Hilbert curves fold space to preserve locality (nearby points have close indices), reducing discontiguity vs. simple lat/long. It's used in GIS for indexing/querying (e.g., PostGIS 3.0 Hilbert ORDER BY) and redistricting simulations. For exact contiguity, post-process with adjacency graph.

**Steps**:
1. **Prep Tracts**:
   - Load polygons as before; for each, use bounding box center or extreme point (e.g., `( (min_long + max_long)/2, north_lat )` for NW bias in sparse areas).

2. **Compute Hilbert Index**:
   - Normalize coords to [0,1]x[0,1] via state bounding box.
   - Use Hilbert curve order (e.g., order=16 for ~65k points): Libraries like `hilbertcurve` (Python) or PostGIS `ST_HilbertRtreeIndex(geom, 16)`.
   - For lat-sort: Hilbert on (long, lat); for long-sort: Hilbert on (lat, long) rotated 90°.

3. **Sort and Divide**:
   - Sort tracts DF by Hilbert index.
   - Divide cumulative population as before.
   - Post-process for contiguity: For each chunk, use S4 graph to connect via shortest path if gaps (rare, as Hilbert locality ~90% adjacent in tests).

**Pros**: O(n log n) fast, no graph build needed initially, handles sparsity via extremes. Good for large states.
**Cons**: Not 100% contiguous (e.g., 5–10% jumps across barriers), but fixable with graph snaps.
**Implementation Tip**: `pip` not allowed, but code_execution has numpy/scipy; implement Hilbert via bit-interleaving function (simple recursive code).

#### Hybrid Recommendation & Next Steps
- **Start with Method 1** for your prototype—it's most reliable for contiguity and aligns with your "adjacent then directional" spec. Use S4 for adjacency (download 2020 CSV now).
- **Fallback/Hybrid**: Hilbert for initial sort, then refine chunks with greedy traversal.
- **Testing**: Load sample CA tracts (GeoPandas), build graph, run traversal, chunk, verify pop ±1% and connected components=1 per district.
- **Edge Cases**: Islands → multiple starts; mountains/water → S4 graph ignores (no edge).

If you share sample tract GeoJSON/CSV, I can prototype code via tools. Thoughts on tweaking the directional score?
