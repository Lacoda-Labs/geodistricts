# GeoDistricts Solution Brief

## Whereas
United States Constitution gives States authority to manage how they elect representatives.

## Problem  
States gerrymandering district boundaries based on registered voters in order to manipulate election outcomes.

## Constraints
US Constitution and statutes (e.g., Voting Rights Act)

## Solution
Define an algorithm that objectively generates district boundaries based on census data and geographic principles.

## Assumptions
- VRA sections found unconstitutional may no longer need consideration or are inherently met by the design of an algorithm that objectively defines congressional districts based on census tracts and geographically based apportionment.
- Census tracts are trusted to be objectively defined.
- Congressional representative apportionments are trusted to be objectively calculated based on statute that limits total to 435 based on census results.

## Benefits
Democracy is preserved as no centralized state authority can be compromised into gerrymandering.

## Algorithm Overview

### Given
- Census tract population data for all US States (from https://api.census.gov/data)
- Geospatial boundaries of census tracts from TIGER/Line shapefiles (from https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb)  
- Number of congressional districts per state

### Core Principles
1. **Population Equality First**: Districts must be as close to equal population as possible (target: <1% variance).
2. **Contiguity Preferred**: Districts should be contiguous when possible, but discontiguity is acceptable for geographic barriers (e.g., islands, water bodies).
3. **Objective & Automated**: No human intervention; algorithm runs deterministically based on census data.
4. **Hierarchical Division**: Use administrative boundaries (counties) as natural grouping units before fine-tuning with census tracts.

### Approach
- Starting with a state's number of allocated congressional representatives (see `congressional-districts.service.ts`), divide total population (of each census tract) to determine target population for each resulting district ("geodistrict").

- **Two-Phase Division Strategy**:
  1. **County-Level Division**: Sort counties geographically and divide into balanced groups by population to create natural administrative boundaries.
  2. **Tract-Level Refinement**: Within each county group, sort tracts geographically and divide to achieve precise population targets.

- Division of district groups is repeated until each district group has only one district.
- Each iteration alternates dividing district groups geographically by latitude and longitude.
- When a district group contains an odd number of districts, subtract 1 from the number of districts in the group and divide by 2, assign the new divided group that even halved number of districts, and the other the same halved number + 1. For example, a district group with 13 districts is divided into two new district groups with 6 in one and 7 in the other and a population ratio of [6/13, 7/13].
    - Population ratios for odd numbers are calculated with the denominator being the total number of districts and even/odd number numerators where one is rounded up and the other rounded down.
- Only divide district groups that have more than one district (i.e., skip dividing district groups with only one district).

### Data Sources
- **Population Data**: Census API (https://api.census.gov/data)
- **Boundary Data**: TIGER/Line shapefiles (https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb)
- **District Counts**: Congressional districts service

### Key Features
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Track each division iteration for transparency and debugging.
- **Population Variance Tracking**: Monitor and report deviations from target population.
- **Contiguity Scoring**: Calculate and report contiguity percentages for each district.
- **Geographic Sorting**: Alternating latitude/longitude sorting ensures balanced geographic distribution.
- **Performance Optimized**: County-level division reduces complexity for large states.
